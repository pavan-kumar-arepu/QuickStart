 /**Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

 Variables are always initialized before use.

 Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.

 Integers are checked for overflow.

 Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.

 Memory is managed automatically.

 Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
